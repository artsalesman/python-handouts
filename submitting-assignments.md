# CS41 Submission Instructions

In CS41, we will submit assignments using [Paperless](https://paperless.stanford.edu/), an online tool that lets the course staff download, test, grade, and comment on your code without using paper copies.

You may be familiar with the Paperless submission process from the CS106 series of courses. We will use Paperless in almost the exact same way.

## Detailed Instructions

1. Open [the Paperless website](https://paperless.stanford.edu) in Google Chrome or Firefox.
2. Click on CS41, where you should be listed as a student.
3. Click "Submit Assignment" in the top-right.
4. Select which assignment you would like to submit from the dropdown. Once you do this, an area should appear where you may upload your assignment files.
5. Drag and drop your assignment files into the area marked "Files."" This will add to the list of files to upload. 
6. Click "Submit Assignment". Once your project is submitted, you will be taken back to the main page of the Paperless website.
7. Confirm that your files were properly submitted. You can view your submission on the Paperless website, which is what your Section Leader will see when grading your submission, by clicking on the "Assignments" tab at the top. You are responsible for checking Paperless to make sure that your files were submitted properly.

You may make as many new submissions as you would like by repeating the steps above. We will receive only the most recent submission.

You must submit all of the files necessary to run your program. These files will typically by Python (`.py`) files containing programs. However, particularly if you are extending the program (say, because you've added some extra features in search of a + or ++), you may also have additional image files or audio files that form part of the submission and should also be submitted.

## Browser Compatibility

Paperless works on Google Chrome and Firefox, so ideally use one of those browsers to submit your code. It also usually works on Safari but has some latent issues. Do not use Internet Explorer to upload submissions to Paperless.

## Submission Time

Whether an assignment is submitted on time is determined by the time we receive your electronic submission, which is timestamped in the submission process. That time is based on the time on the server that receives the assignment, so it pays to submit
things with a few minutes to spare, particularly if you discover that your computerâ€™s clock is running
slow.

## Back Up Your Work

Although we work hard to keep track of all the assignments that come in, assignments have sometimes not been received as expected. If your assignment goes missing, you will need to resubmit. *To make resubmission possible, you are responsible for keeping a backup copy of your work.*
