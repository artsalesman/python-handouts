# Installing Python on macOS

Hello!

This document provides a walkthrough to set up a Python development environment for [CS41](https://stanfordpython.com) on macOS. Alternate versions of this guide exist for [Linux](https://github.com/stanfordpython/python-handouts/blob/master/installing-python-linux.md) and [Windows](https://github.com/stanfordpython/python-handouts/blob/master/installing-python-windows.md) development.

## Overview

In this course, you'll be writing lots of Python code, so it's important to get your development environment set up and ready-to-go. Moreover, we will sometimes need to install dependencies and packages, so we want to make sure that everything gets installed to the right place as well. The tools we learn about in this document will also be useful for any external development you might pursue in Python.

Throughout this document, we will:

1. Install Python 3.7.2
2. Create a virtual environment using this version of Python.
3. Inside this environment, install useful packages.
4. (Optional) Modify the shell startup script to always activate our environment.

This approach works well and is straightforward to set up, but has its drawbacks. For those who feel more comfortable with the command line, we also provide instructions for a "better" solution involving a tool named `virtualenvwrapper`. Use of `virtualenvwrapper` is by no means necessary, but it can be nice to set up. To set up `virtualenvwrapper`, we will:

1. Reset our environment to the default state.
2. Use Python 3.7.2's `pip` to install `virtualenvwrapper` globally.
3. Use `virtualenvwrapper` to create a managed virtual environment.
4. Inside this environment, install useful packages.
5. Modify the shell startup script to enable `virtualenvwrapper`'s tools by default.
6. (Optional) Modify the shell startup script to always activate our environment.

Let's get started!

## Install Python 3.7.2

*Note: If you use `brew` or another package manager for Python installations, see the note at the bottom of this section instead.*

Navigate to the [Python 3.7.2 download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-372/) in a web browser.

Scroll to the bottom of the page to the section labelled "Files."

Install the Python distribution that corresponds to your version of macOS. If you are running OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) or later, download the ["macOS 64-bit installer."](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.2/python-3.7.2-macosx10.9.pkg). If you are running OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), OS X 10.7 (Lion), or OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion), you will need to download the ["macOS 64-bit/32-bit installer"](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.2/python-3.7.2-macosx10.6.pkg). If you need, you can determine which macOS your computer is running with [these instructions from Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201260).

After downloading, double-click the downloaded file, and follow the on-screen instructions.

Let's double check that Python 3.7.2 was installed correctly.

For the remainder of this setup document, we assume that you have a basic familiarity with the command line. We understand that not everyone will feel comfortable with the command line, because it is usually covered starting in CS107. However, I highly recommend using Nick Troccoli's amazing [CS107 resources](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs107/cs107.1194/resources/) for this quarter if you feel less experienced, particular the section titled "Common Unix Commands."

The main takeaway is the following: If you see the line:

```
sredmond$ command
```

Then copy and paste the command into your command line prompt. Open up a command line prompt (likely using Terminal.app or iTerm.app), and run the following commands:

```
sredmond$ which python3
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin/python3
sredmond$ python3 --version
Python 3.7.2
```

If you see the output shown above, then Python 3.7.2 was installed correctly on your machine!

Let's celebrate by writing some code! Run the following from a command prompt. You should see the following output, which leaves you at an interactive prompt, at which you can write Python code.

```
sredmond$ python3
Python 3.7.2 (v3.7.2:9a3ffc0492, Dec 24 2018, 02:44:43)
[Clang 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print("Hello world!")
Hello world!
>>> quit()
sredmond$ 
```

Try writing some Python (perhaps `print("Hello world!")`) in the interactive interpreter! When you're done, you can exit the interactive interpreter by entering `quit()` at the Python command prompt or by pressing CTRL+D.

#### Other package managers: `brew`

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is "the missing package manager for macOS." It's a great way to install, upgrade, and manage many different types of packages on macOS, including Python. If you are not using `brew`, there is no requirement that you start for CS41. However, if you are already using `brew`, you might as well install Python through brew.

Run `brew install python3`. This will fetch the latest version of Python (which might not be Python 3.7.2, but that's all we can do).

Then, continue the process above, after the installation of Python 3.7.2.

### Troubleshooting

#### `which python3` shows no output
The `which` command searches your computer for a program matching a name. If `which python3` shows no output, it means that your computer can't find any appropriate `python3`. Pause and flag down a member of the course staff to help debug, or ask on Piazza. Include as much detail as you can about the problem.

#### `python3 --version` does not show `Python 3.7.2`
In this case, the version of Python 3 your computer wants to run is not the Python 3.7.2 that we just downloaded. Pause and flag down a member of the course staff to help debug, or ask on Piazza. Include as much detail as you can about the problem.

## Create a virtual environment

We've correctly installed Python, so next we will create a virtual environment. You can learn more about virtual environments [here](https://github.com/stanfordpython/python-handouts/blob/master/virtual-environments.md) or at the end of our [lecture slides](https://stanfordpython.com/#lectures) on Python fundamentals, but for now it is sufficient to think of a virtual environment as an isolated sandbox for Python packages and dependencies.

Specifically, we will create a folder named `cs41-env` in your computer's home folder. The configuration of our virtual environment will live entirely inside of this folder.

```
sredmond$ python3 --version
Python 3.7.2
sredmond$ python3 -m venv ~/cs41-env
```

If these two lines execute without error, you have successfully created a virtual environment named `cs41-env`.

*Note: If you move the `cs41-env` folder, some of the internal structure of the virtual environment can break in unpredictable ways. This is one of the drawbacks of standard virtual environments that motivate our more advanced usage of `virtualenvwrapper` later in this document.*

### Activating a virtual environment

For a given terminal session, a virtual environment is either active or inactive at any moment in time. To activate our virtual environment, you will need to run

```
sredmond$ source ~/cs41-env/bin/activate
(cs41-env) sredmond$
```

*Note: If your shell is `tcsh` or `csh`, you will have to run `source ~/cs41-env/bin/activate.csh` instead. If your shell is `fish`, you will have to run `. ~/cs41-env/bin/activate.fish` instead.*

Observe that our command prompt, which previously was `sredmond$`, now is `(cs41-env) sredmond$`. This is one method by which you can see whether a virtual environment is activated.

### Deactivating a virtual environment

Deactivating a virtual environment is easy. From an activated environment, simply run

```
(cs41-env) sredmond$ deactivate
sredmond$
```

Don't worry if you deactivate from an inactive environment. Nothing bad will happen, although you might see a `-bash: deactivate: command not found` error message, which you can safely ignore.

### Using an activated virtual environment.

Let's reactivate our virtual environment to see what's different when a virtual environment is active.

```
sredmond$ source ~/cs41-env/bin/activate
(cs41-env) sredmond$ which python3
/Users/sredmond/cs41-env/bin/python3
(cs41-env) sredmond$ which python
/Users/sredmond/cs41-env/bin/python
(cs41-env) sredmond$ which pip3
/Users/sredmond/cs41-env/bin/pip3
(cs41-env) sredmond$ which pip
/Users/sredmond/cs41-env/bin/pip
```

It looks like all of our python-related commands are now located inside of the virtual environment. That's a good thing! You can confirm this by seeing that `/Users/sredmond/cs41-env/bin:` is the first entry of the string printed by running `echo $PATH`.

Moreover, observe that:

```
(cs41-env) sredmond$ python3 --version
Python 3.7.2
(cs41-env) sredmond$ python --version
Python 3.7.2
(cs41-env) sredmond$ pip3 --version
pip 18.1 from /Users/sredmond/cs41-env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pip (python 3.7)
(cs41-env) sredmond$ pip --version
pip 18.1 from /Users/sredmond/cs41-env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pip (python 3.7)
```

The big takeaway is that, inside our active virtual environment, the commands `python` and `pip` now refer to Python 3.7.2 and it's associated package manager.

For example, when the virtual environment is active, we can enter an interactive Python 3 prompt simply by running:

```
sredmond$ python
Python 3.7.2 (v3.7.2:9a3ffc0492, Dec 24 2018, 02:44:43)
[Clang 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
```

*As a reminder, you can quit the interactive Python prompt with `quit()` or CTRL+D.*

## Use `pip` to Install Useful Packages

Next, we'll install useful Python packages that will serve us over the duration of this course. Let's first make sure that we're have activated the virtual environment.

```
sredmond$ source ~/cs41-env/bin/activate
```

Now, we'll update `pip`, Python's builtin package manager, just to make sure it's on the latest version (it should be).

```
(cs41-env) sredmond$ pip install --upgrade pip
Requirement already up-to-date: pip in ./cs41-env/lib/python3.7/site-packages (18.1)
```

After, we'll install the suite of Jupyter tools and some additional useful packages

```
# Really, really make sure that you have activated `cs41-env` before running this line!
(cs41-env) sredmond$ pip install "ipython[all]" jupyter jupyterlab numpy scipy matplotlib nltk scikit-learn requests pycodestyle autopep8 Pillow
```

This will produce a huge amount of output, as Python is downloading these third-party libraries and tools from the internet and storing them inside our virtual environment. These packages will be available when our virtual environment is activated, but will not necessarily be available if our virtual environment is disactivated. For this reason, it's important to always have an active virtual environment when working on code in this class.

The last few lines of the output should look like the following. If your output is dramatically different from this or the installation failed with an error, pause and get a member of the course staff to help or post on Piazza.

```

We will learn more about each of these packages throughout this course.

Most relevantly, you should now have access to `ipython`, an interactive Python interpreter that is vastly superior to the default Python interpreter. You can read an overview [here](http://ipython.readthedocs.org/en/stable/overview.html) if you'd like. To make sure `ipython` is configured correctly, run it from a command prompt, and ensure that you get something similar to the below.

```
(cs41-env)$ ipython
Python 3.7.2 (v3.7.2:9a3ffc0492, Dec 24 2018, 02:44:43)
Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
IPython 7.2.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.

In [1]: 
```

One helpful feature of `ipython` is that you can append a `'?'` to any symbol and Python will try to give you help for that symbol. For example:

```
(cs41-env)$ ipython
Python 3.7.2 (default, Dec 27 2018, 07:35:06)
Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
IPython 7.2.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.

In [1]: print?
Docstring:
print(value, ..., sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)

Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.
Optional keyword arguments:
file:  a file-like object (stream); defaults to the current sys.stdout.
sep:   string inserted between values, default a space.
end:   string appended after the last value, default a newline.
flush: whether to forcibly flush the stream.
Type:      builtin_function_or_method
```

And that's it! You are all done setting up your Python development environment for CS41.

## Summary

First, we installed Python 3.7.2 from the Python website and checked that everything was installed correctly. Next, we used `python3` to create a virtual environment named `cs41-env`, and we learned how to activate and deactivate this virtual environment. Lastly, we activated the environment and installed lots of useful packages.

**Reminder: Each time you create a new terminal session, you will need to run `source ~/cs41-env/bin/activate`.**

## IMPORTANT! Activating virtual environments

One very important note is that our virtual environment will not be activated by default. This means that, for every new command line session you create (for example, by opening a new tab in Terminal.app or iTerm.app), you will need to run `source ~/cs41-env/bin/activate` to activate the `cs41-env` virtual environment. A good rule to remember is: if you don't see `(cs41-env)` at the start of the command prompt, then the virtual environment is not active!

In this course, we always assume that you are operating in an active virtual environment. So, it's crucially important that you activate the `cs41-env` environment by running `source ~/cs41-env/bin/activate` in every terminal session you use for this class.

### Optional: Automatically enable `cs41-env`

If you want to automatically enable the `cs41-env` virtual environment every time you start a new interactive session, you can add a command to your shell's startup script. In most cases, this will be `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc`, which are different but in ways we don't care about. Run:

```
sredmond$ echo "# Activate virtual environment for CS41." >> ~/.bash_profile
sredmond$ echo "source ~/cs41-env/bin/activate" >> ~/.bash_profile
sredmond$ tail -n 2 ~/.bash_profile
# Activate virtual environment for CS41.
source ~/cs41-env/bin/activate
```

This will cause the command `source ~/cs41-env/bin/activate` to be executed every time you open a new terminal session. Since this script gets executed every time you create a new terminal session, the `cs41-env` will be automatically activated. It can still be deactivated by running `deactivate`.

*Note: If you are using a different shell (`tcsh`, `zsh`, etc) than `bash`, you will need to place this startup command in your appropriate startup script, such as `~/.tcshrc` or `~/.zshrc`.*

## A "better" alternative: `virtualenvwrapper`

Next, we'll install `virtualenvwrapper`. It is a third-party tool which is used to manage your Python virtual environments. For users who are not comfortable with the command line, I recommend stopping now with the successful installation of your virtual environment in the previous section.

**Only follow the commands in this section if you are moderately comfortable with the command line.**


First, we will install the `virtualenvwrapper` package. You will need to grant root privileges to the installation script (thus the `sudo`), which will prompt you to enter a password.

Note: `virtualenvwrapper` only works with `bash`, `ksh`, and `zsh`. Ensure that you are using one of those shells for these installation steps.

```

```

Next, we'll need to do some one-time setup to configure the virtual environment for this class.

```
$ export WORKON_HOME="${HOME}/.virtualenvs"
$ export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON="$(which python3)"
```

This instructs the `virtualenvwrapper` utility to store all of your virtual environments in the folder `.virtualenvs/` in your home directory, and tells it that we'd like to use our version of Python 3.7 for our virtual environments.

Next, we'll need to find the location of the `virtualenvwrapper.sh` script, which was downloaded by `pip` above. It should be at `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh`, but let's make sure. Run:

```
$ cat /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
```

*Note: If you installed Python 3.7.2 using `brew`, then `virtualenvwrapper.sh` is installed in a different location. It is likely installed at `"$(brew --prefix)"/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh`, so try using this path instead of the above.*

*If you've used a different package manager, see the below section on finding your `virtualenvwrapper.sh`.*

Next, we're going to set up the virtual environment wrapper tools:

```
$ source /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
virtualenvwrapper.user_scripts creating /Users/sredmond/.virtualenvs/premkproject
virtualenvwrapper.user_scripts creating /Users/sredmond/.virtualenvs/postmkproject
virtualenvwrapper.user_scripts creating /Users/sredmond/.virtualenvs/initialize
virtualenvwrapper.user_scripts creating /Users/sredmond/.virtualenvs/premkvirtualenv
virtualenvwrapper.user_scripts creating /Users/sredmond/.virtualenvs/postmkvirtualenv
virtualenvwrapper.user_scripts creating /Users/sredmond/.virtualenvs/prermvirtualenv
virtualenvwrapper.user_scripts creating /Users/sredmond/.virtualenvs/postrmvirtualenv
virtualenvwrapper.user_scripts creating /Users/sredmond/.virtualenvs/predeactivate
virtualenvwrapper.user_scripts creating /Users/sredmond/.virtualenvs/postdeactivate
virtualenvwrapper.user_scripts creating /Users/sredmond/.virtualenvs/preactivate
virtualenvwrapper.user_scripts creating /Users/sredmond/.virtualenvs/postactivate
virtualenvwrapper.user_scripts creating /Users/sredmond/.virtualenvs/get_env_details 
```

*Remember to source the path to your `virtualenvwrapper.sh`, which may be different from the above if you installed Python from some package manager.

### Find `virtualenvwrapper.sh`

Can't find your `virtualenvwrapper.sh`? This section will go over some tools to search your computer for it.

On a Mac, the easiest way to do this is with `mdfind`, which emulates the behavior of Spotlight in the terminal:

```
$ mdfind virtualenvwrapper.sh
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
/usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
$
```

Copy the first result to your clipboard. If you see no results, or if you see an error like `mdfind: Command not found.`, you can also try the (slower but also effective) command:

```
$ find / -name virtualenvwrapper.sh
< ... lots and lots of output ... >
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
/usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
$
```

Copy the first result to your clipboard if you didn't have any luck with `mdfind`.

If there are no results from the `find` command, go back and make sure that you have successfully installed `virtualenvwrapper` with `pip`. If further problems persist, contact a staff member.

### Work on virtual environments

In order to make sure everything went smoothly, run `workon` from the command prompt. This command prints a list of environments, currently empty.

```
$ workon
$
```
If you see a message like `workon: command not found`, then you have not successfully sourced the `virtualenvwrapper.sh` script in this terminal session.

Now, we'll actually create the virtual environment for CS41. You can name your virtual environment anything you want, but we recommend a short, easy-to-remember name like `cs41-env`. When you run `mkvirtualenv`, a new environment is created, and we specify the particular version of Python to use via the `--python` option.

```
$ mkvirtualenv --python=`which python3` cs41-env
Running virtualenv with interpreter /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin/python3
Using base prefix '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7'
New python executable in /Users/sredmond/.virtualenvs/cs41-env/bin/python3
Also creating executable in /Users/sredmond/.virtualenvs/cs41-env/bin/python
Installing setuptools, pip, wheel...
done.
virtualenvwrapper.user_scripts creating /Users/sredmond/.virtualenvs/cs41-env/bin/predeactivate
virtualenvwrapper.user_scripts creating /Users/sredmond/.virtualenvs/cs41-env/bin/postdeactivate
virtualenvwrapper.user_scripts creating /Users/sredmond/.virtualenvs/cs41-env/bin/preactivate
virtualenvwrapper.user_scripts creating /Users/sredmond/.virtualenvs/cs41-env/bin/postactivate
virtualenvwrapper.user_scripts creating /Users/sredmond/.virtualenvs/cs41-env/bin/get_env_details
```

Now, if you run `workon`, you should see the list of all environments, which now includes `cs41-env`.

```
(cs41-env)$ workon
cs41-env
$
```

Let's make sure everything is running smoothly. Run all of the following commands and ensure that the output is appropriate.

```
(cs41-env)$ which python
/Users/sredmond/.virtualenvs/cs41-env/bin/python
(cs41-env)$ python --version
Python 3.7.2
(cs41-env)$ python -c "print('Hello world.')"
Hello world!
(cs41-env)$ which pip
/Users/sredmond/.virtualenvs/cs41-env/bin/pip
(cs41-env)$ pip --version
pip 18.1 from /Users/sredmond/.virtualenvs/cs41-env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pip (python 3.7)
```

Lastly, install the useful Python packages discussed above into this virtual environment. Make sure that you are executing this `pip install` command from an active virtual environment.

```
(cs41-env)$
$ pip install "ipython[all]" jupyter jupyterlab numpy scipy matplotlib nltk scikit-learn requests pep8 autopep8 Pillow
```

### Startup Commands and Cleanup

Every time you develop code for CS41, you will need to run `workon cs41-env` in order to activate your virtual environment. To deactivate it, you can run `deactivate`. 

Open your `~/.bash_profile` startup script for editing with the following command:

```
$ open -e ~/.bash_profile
```

Scroll to the bottom, and delete the line `source ~/cs41-env/bin/activate` if it exists. Save the file and return to the command line.

Now, let's finish up by enabling `virtualenvwrapper` tools and (optionally) automating the activation our virtual environment.

```
$ deactivate
$ echo "export WORKON_HOME=${HOME}/.virtualenvs" >> ~/.bash_profile
$ echo "export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=`which python3`" >> ~/.bash_profile
$ echo "source /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh" >> ~/.bash_profile
```

It might be convenient to add `workon cs41-env` to your shell startup script. Optionally, run the following command, which will result in automatic activation of the CS41 virtual environment whenever you start a new shell session.

```
$ echo "workon cs41-env" >> ~/.bash_profile
```

To see that everything was appended correctly, run

```
$ tail ~/.bash_profile
< ... possibly some other stuff ... >
export WORKON_HOME=/Users/sredmond/.virtualenvs
export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin/python3
source /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
workon cs41-env
```

The last line is optional. If you used a different path to `python3` or to `virtualenvwrapper.sh`, you will see corresponding output above.

If you use a different shell startup script (for example, `~/.profile`), you will need to append the same line to the end of that startup script.

### Cleaning Up

If you've successfully made it through these `virtualenvwrapper` instructions, you are almost all ready to go. We will finish by removing up our old non-`virtualenvwrapper` installation.

Run the following command to delete our virtual environment at `~/cs41-env`. As always, when running an `rm` command, make sure that you are aware which files are going to be deleted. If you don't feel confident that you know what this command will do, you can delete the folder from a Finder window.

```
$ rm -rf "${HOME}/cs41-env"
```

Finally, you can deactivate your virtual environment by running

```
(cs41-env)$ deactivate
```

That's it!

### Final Confirmation

Open a new Terminal or iTerm window, and run the following to make sure that everything is correctly installed.

```
$ workon cs41-env
(cs41-env)$ python --version
Python 3.7.2
(cs41-env)$ pip --version
pip 18.1 from /Users/sredmond/.virtualenvs/cs41-env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pip (python 3.7)
(cs41-env)$ ipython
